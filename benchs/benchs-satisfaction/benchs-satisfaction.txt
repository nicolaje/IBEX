Diverse benchmarks in constraint satisfaction problems with well constrained problems are stored here.in Quimper 

All these problems have 0 or a finite number of solutions.


They are grouped in the following directories

benchs-coprin                     polynomial problems from the constraint benches web page 
				  http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/logiciels/ALIAS/Benches/benches.html

benchs-coprin/non-poly            non polynomial problems from the constraint benches web page
                                       http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/logiciels/ALIAS/Benches/node2.html

benchs-IBB                       decomposable  problems described in the IBB paper in Constraint Journal 2010

Some problems are scalable : they have been generated for several dimensions
