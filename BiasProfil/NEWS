Profil-2.0.6 - 2008-10-14
-------------------------'
Fixed:
+ Starting with GCC series 4.2 functions aren't allowed to have a (VOID) argument list with VOID
being typedef'ed to void. The current version uses (void) instead.
+ Since GCC series 4.3 C++ header file dependencies have been streamlined causing the memcpy
prototype to be missing in Utilities.C.

Profil-2.0.4 - 2006-10-05
--------------------------'
New:
+ PROFIL/BIAS is now licensed under the GPL.

Fixed:
+ GCC 4.1 changed the handling of friend functions causing the build of
PROFIL/BIAS to fail. This is fixed in the current release.
+ The automatic differentiation package's handling of hessian matrices was
fixed. This should enhance performance and reduce the memory usage considerably.
+ There were some minor bugs in the local Brent solver.

2005-10-19 - Profil-2.0.2
--------------------------'
+ Added ILSS version with approximate inverse supplied as a parameter.
+ Fixed some comments in BIAS/Bias1.c, BIAS/Bias2.c.
+ Bugs fixed:
  + minor issues with memory management
  + missing CONST added to 2nd parameter of 
    src/Functions.C:Power(CONST INTERVAL &, CONST INTERVAL &)
